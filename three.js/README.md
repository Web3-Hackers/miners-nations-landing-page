### What is The Miners Nation?

The Miners Nation is a first person shooter game where players fend off enemies to collect PC parts. Players can then exchange parts for Rig Token and purchase more parts to buidl a rig. Players also have the ability to mint parts on Open Sea as NFTs. These same NFTs can be combined to buidl a rig (Marketplace in development). Once a rig is assembled a player can then use the rig to mine Rig Token. Rig Token will be used to exchange for other tokens on exchanges.
