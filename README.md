# The Miners Nation

### What is The Miners Nation?

The Miners Nation is a first person shooter game where players fend off enemies to collect PC parts. Players can then exchange parts for Rig Token and purchase more parts to buidl a rig. Players also have the ability to mint parts on Open Sea as NFTs. These same NFTs can be combined to buidl a rig (Marketplace in development). Once a rig is assembled a player can then use the rig to mine Rig Token. Rig Token will be used to exchange for other tokens on exchanges.

### How to get started?

Build a 3D cryptocurrency mining rig to start mining the native $MINE token!

### How do you login/signup?

MetaMask. MetaMask is a software cryptocurrency wallet used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to access their Ethereum wallet through a browser extension or mobile app, which can then be used to interact with decentralized applications.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, get a Free Moralis Admin account [here](https://admin.moralis.io/register). Then, create a new server (Mainnet/Testnet) and choose Avalanche as the required chain. Once a server is created, get the App Id and Server Url and copy them to the `.env` file which can be created by copying `.env.example` and renaming it.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_MORALIS_APP_ID=xxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_MORALIS_SERVER_URL=xxx
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
